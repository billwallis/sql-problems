# SQL Problems

Solutions to SQL problems.

I've only bothered solving the hardest (free) problems, and I'll add some notes on what I thought of the platform below.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This repository will contain spoilers for the problems. If you want to solve them yourself, do not look at the solutions.

## Pre-requisites

This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage the Python dependencies and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to spin up the databases.

To install these, follow the instructions on their websites:

- https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/
- https://www.python.org/downloads/
- https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

## Quick start

After installing the pre-requisites and cloning this repo, just run Docker's `compose` command.

```bash
uv sync --all-groups
docker compose --profile build up --detach
docker compose down --volumes  # When you're finished
```

This will take a little while to run since there's a fair bit of data to chunk through. To build all services, skip the `--profile build` flag; to customise which services to build, adjust the `docker-compose.yaml` file.

You can connect to the databases using any of your favourite SQL clients.

## Reviews

Reviews of the platforms can be found at:

These are just my opinions, and you may have a different experience.

### ðŸ”´ Hard

### â­• Skipped

There were some problem sites that I chose to skip completely:

- [SQL Police Department](https://sqlpd.com/): This uses a point-and-click interface, you don't actually write the SQL yourself. Might be good for complete beginners. Has some free "cases" to solve.
- [SQL Practice](https://sqlpractice.io/practice-questions): There are no free hard questions.
- [Interview Master](https://www.interviewmaster.ai/home): Doesn't support password authentication and you can't access questions without an account. Feels like a rip-off of [SQL Practice](https://sqlpractice.io/practice-questions).

For clarity, I'm only reviewing problem sites and the following are (interactive) courses/tutorials, so I've also skipped these:

- [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/search?page_search_query=sql)
- [SQLZoo](https://sqlzoo.net/wiki/SQL_Tutorial)
- [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/catalog/language/sql)
- [SQLBolt](https://sqlbolt.com/)
- [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/catalog?searchValue=sql)
- [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/courses-all?q=sql)
- [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=sql)
- [LearnSQL](https://learnsql.com/)
- [Mode](https://mode.com/sql-tutorial)
