    This question should clarify whether weeks start on a Sunday or Monday!

    For example, the date 2021-08-01 is a Sunday. MySQL uses Sunday as the
    week-start day, whereas PostgreSQL uses Monday as the week-start day:

    MySQL (8.0.35)

        select
            week(cast('2021-07-31' as date)),  -- 30
            week(cast('2021-08-01' as date)),  -- 31
            week(cast('2021-08-02' as date))   -- 31

    PostgreSQL (14.3)

        select
            extract('week' from '2021-07-31'::date),  -- 30
            extract('week' from '2021-08-01'::date),  -- 30
            extract('week' from '2021-08-02'::date)   -- 31

    The result set implies that Sunday should be used as the week-start day,
    but the question does not clarify that at all!
