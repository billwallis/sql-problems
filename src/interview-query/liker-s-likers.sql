    Another not "hard" one -- this is just a simpler version of the "John's

/* Solution (PostgreSQL) */
select
    count(distinct likers_likes.liker_id) as count,
    likes.liker_id as user
from likes
    inner join likes as likers_likes
        on likes.liker_id = likers_likes.user_id
group by likes.liker_id
;
