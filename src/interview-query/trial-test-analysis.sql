    Only MySQL is available for this question ðŸ˜­

    As mentioned in the comments, the problem statement is incorrect (again)
    ðŸ™„ It says that:

    > For control group: Count as converted if they subscribed anytime after
      entering the experiment

    ...but the expected result set implies that this _should_ say:

    > For control group: Count as converted if they subscribed anytime after
      entering the experiment AND havenâ€™t cancelled

    Problem statement confusion aside, this is not a "hard" problem at all.
