    Only MySQL is available for this question ðŸ˜­

    The notification logic and definition of "conversion" isn't clear enough
    here and, as others have mentioned in the comments, the third test case
    is definitely wrongly stored:

    - There are only 8 events in the `notifications` table
    - The expected output is:

        | notification_type | conversion_rate |
        |-------------------+-----------------|
        | new_feature       | 0.667           |
        | promotion         | 0.250           |
        | reminder          | 0.333           |

      ...whose corresponding fractions would be:

        â€¢ new_feature = 2/3
        â€¢ promotion   = 1/4
        â€¢ reminder    = 1/3

      ...which would imply a total notification count of 10 (3 + 4 + 3).

    - But 8 != 10, so the test case solution is using a different number of
      events.
