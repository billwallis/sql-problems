    A. Customer Journey

    Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the
    subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s
    onboarding journey.

    Try to keep it as short as possible - you may also want to run some sort
    of join to make your explanations a bit easier!

    B. Data Analysis Questions

    1.  How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
    2.  What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for
        our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
    3.  What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our
        dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
    4.  What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have
        churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
    5.  How many customers have churned straight after their initial free
        trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
    6.  What is the number and percentage of customer plans after their
        initial free trial?
    7.  What is the customer count and percentage breakdown of all 5
        plan_name values at 2020-12-31?
    8.  How many customers have upgraded to an annual plan in 2020?
    9.  How many days on average does it take for a customer to an annual
        plan from the day they join Foodie-Fi?
    10. Can you further breakdown this average value into 30 day periods
        (i.e. 0-30 days, 31-60 days etc)
    11. How many customers downgraded from a pro monthly to a basic monthly
        plan in 2020?

    C. Challenge Payment Question

    The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year
    2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions
    table with the following requirements:

    - monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original
      start_date of any monthly paid plan
    - upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current
      paid amount in that month and start immediately
    - upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the
      current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
    - once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

    D. Outside The Box Questions

    The following are open ended questions which might be asked during a
    technical interview for this case study - there are no right or wrong
    answers, but answers that make sense from both a technical and a
    business perspective make an amazing impression!

    1.  How would you calculate the rate of growth for Foodie-Fi?
    2.  What key metrics would you recommend Foodie-Fi management to track
        over time to assess performance of their overall business?
    3.  What are some key customer journeys or experiences that you would
        analyse further to improve customer retention?
    4.  If the Foodie-Fi team were to create an exit survey shown to
        customers who wish to cancel their subscription, what questions
        would you include in the survey?
    5.  What business levers could the Foodie-Fi team use to reduce the
        customer churn rate? How would you validate the effectiveness of
        your ideas?
