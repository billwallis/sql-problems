    C. Data Allocation Challenge

    To test out a few different hypotheses - the Data Bank team wants to run
    an experiment where different groups of customers would be allocated
    data using 3 different options:

    - Option 1: data is allocated based off the amount of money at the end
      of the previous month
    - Option 2: data is allocated on the average amount of money kept in the
      account in the previous 30 days
    - Option 3: data is updated real-time

    For this multi-part challenge question - you have been requested to
    generate the following data elements to help the Data Bank team estimate
    how much data will need to be provisioned for each option:

    - running customer balance column that includes the impact each transaction
    - customer balance at the end of each month
    - minimum, average and maximum values of the running balance for each customer

    Using all of the data available - how much data would have been required
    for each option on a monthly basis?
*/

-- cba, pretty much all done above


/*
    D. Extra Challenge

    Data Bank wants to try another option which is a bit more difficult to
    implement - they want to calculate data growth using an interest
    calculation, just like in a traditional savings account you might have
    with a bank.

    If the annual interest rate is set at 6% and the Data Bank team wants to
    reward its customers by increasing their data allocation based off the
    interest calculated on a daily basis at the end of each day, how much
    data would be required for this option on a monthly basis?

    Special notes:

    - Data Bank wants an initial calculation which does not allow for
      compounding interest, however they may also be interested in a daily
      compounding interest calculation so you can try to perform this
      calculation if you have the stamina!

-- don't really understand the question, skipping


/*
    Extension Request

    The Data Bank team wants you to use the outputs generated from the above
    sections to create a quick Powerpoint presentation which will be used as
    marketing materials for both external investors who might want to buy
    Data Bank shares and new prospective customers who might want to bank
    with Data Bank.

    Using the outputs generated from the customer node questions, generate a
    few headline insights which Data Bank might use to market itâ€™s
    world-leading security features to potential investors and customers.

    With the transaction analysis - prepare a 1 page presentation slide
    which contains all the relevant information about the various options
    for the data provisioning so the Data Bank management team can make an
    informed decision.
