    A. Data Exploration and Cleansing

    1.  Update the fresh_segments.interest_metrics table by modifying the
        month_year column to be a date data type with the start of the month
    2.  What is count of records in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics for
        each month_year value sorted in chronological order (earliest to
        latest) with the null values appearing first?
    3.  What do you think we should do with these null values in the
        fresh_segments.interest_metrics
    4.  How many interest_id values exist in the fresh_segments.interest_metrics
        table but not in the fresh_segments.interest_map table? What about
        the other way around?
    5.  Summarise the id values in the fresh_segments.interest_map by its
        total record count in this table
    6.  What sort of table join should we perform for our analysis and why?
        Check your logic by checking the rows where interest_id = 21246 in
        your joined output and include all columns from fresh_segments.interest_metrics
        and all columns from fresh_segments.interest_map except from the id column.
    7.  Are there any records in your joined table where the month_year
        value is before the created_at value from the fresh_segments.interest_map
        table? Do you think these values are valid and why?

    B. Interest Analysis

    1.  Which interests have been present in all month_year dates in our dataset?
    2.  Using this same total_months measure - calculate the cumulative
        percentage of all records starting at 14 months - which total_months
        value passes the 90% cumulative percentage value?
    3.  If we were to remove all interest_id values which are lower than the
        total_months value we found in the previous question - how many
        total data points would we be removing?
    4.  Does this decision make sense to remove these data points from a
        business perspective? Use an example where there are all 14 months
        present to a removed interest example for your arguments - think
        about what it means to have less months present from a segment
        perspective.
    5.  After removing these interests - how many unique interests are
        there for each month?

    C. Segment Analysis

    1.  Using our filtered dataset by removing the interests with less than
        6 months worth of data, which are the top 10 and bottom 10 interests
        which have the largest composition values in any month_year? Only
        use the maximum composition value for each interest but you must
        keep the corresponding month_year
    2.  Which 5 interests had the lowest average ranking value?
    3.  Which 5 interests had the largest standard deviation in their
        percentile_ranking value?
    4.  For the 5 interests found in the previous question - what was
        minimum and maximum percentile_ranking values for each interest and
        its corresponding year_month value? Can you describe what is
        happening for these 5 interests?
    5.  How would you describe our customers in this segment based off their
        composition and ranking values? What sort of products or services
        should we show to these customers and what should we avoid?

    D. Index Analysis

    The index_value is a measure which can be used to reverse calculate the
    average composition for Fresh Segmentsâ€™ clients.

    Average composition can be calculated by dividing the composition column
    by the index_value column rounded to 2 decimal places.

    1.  What is the top 10 interests by the average composition for each month?
    2.  For all of these top 10 interests - which interest appears the most often?
    3.  What is the average of the average composition for the top 10
        interests for each month?
    4.  What is the 3 month rolling average of the max average composition
        value from September 2018 to August 2019 and include the previous
        top ranking interests in the same output shown below.
    5.  Provide a possible reason why the max average composition might
        change from month to month? Could it signal something is not quite
        right with the overall business model for Fresh Segments?
